# SC LEARNING RESOURCES

SuperCollider learning resources have a tendency to be spread out and sort of hidden away in hard-to-find places of the internet. 

To make the learning process easier, here is a compilation of the best and most useful resources out there (that are outside of the documentation).

---

[Thor Magnussons e-book](https://thormagnusson.gitbooks.io/scoring/content/ ) 

This is a very practical and example ridden approach to SuperCollider. 
It's full of great signal processing tricks and tips for sound design.

[A gentle introduction to SuperCollider](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~ruviaro/texts/A_Gentle_Introduction_To_SuperCollider.pdf)

A great, cohesive and free e-book that works great as an introduction to
the language and a programming way of thinking about music

[Livecode SuperCollider](https://theseanco.github.io/howto_co34pt_liveCode/)

A concise guide to live coding in SuperCollider using ProxySpace, patterns
and live "patching", etc. 

[Faking object-oriented programming in SuperCollider with
Events](http://www.tmroyal.com/supercollider-pseudoclasses-with-events.html)

An annoyance for many when designing object oriented projects in SuperCollider is that you
have to recompile constantly. This event-based trick is a workaround that makes your code easy to use and nice.

[Nick Collins' SuperCollider tutorial](http://composerprogrammer.com/teaching/supercollider/sctutorial/tutorial.html)

Another really good and practical SuperCollider tutorial by one of the
heavy weights of the community. Highly recommend Collins' [machine listening work too](https://composerprogrammer.com/teaching/supercollider/advanced/#machinelistening)(there's a chapter in the MIT book on this).

[Eli Fieldsteel's video
tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRzsOOiJ_p4&list=PLPYzvS8A_rTaNDweXe6PX4CXSGq4iEWYC)

Great series of YouTube tutorials on a range of subjects. Really informative and pedagogically sound way of learning SuperCollider and Eli is a very knowledgable instructor.

[Fredrik Olofsson's course materials for UdK Berlin](http://redfrik.github.io/udk00-Audiovisual_Programming/)   

An amazing collection of deep knowledge. A real treasure trove of practical SuperCollider stuff and lots of ways to interact with other systems like Arduinos, Processing, Unity 3D, etc.
